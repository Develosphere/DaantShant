    "bleeding gums": (
        "Gums often bleed because plaque irritates the gum tissue. "
        "Gentle brushing with a soft-bristled brush, daily flossing, and "
        "warm saltwater rinses usually help reduce the inflammation over time."
    ),
    "toothache": (
        "A toothache can happen because of cavities, sensitivity, gum "
        "inflammation, or even a small crack in the tooth. Over-the-counter "
        "pain relief and a warm saltwater rinse can help for now, but if it "
        "persists or worsens, a dental check-up is recommended."
    ),
    "sensitivity": (
        "Tooth sensitivity is usually caused by thinning enamel or receding "
        "gums that expose the inner layer of the tooth. Using a sensitivity "
        "toothpaste and avoiding very hot or cold foods can help. If it "
        "keeps happening, a dentist can check for cracks or decay."
    ),
    "tartar/plaque buildup": (
        "Hard yellow buildup near the gums is often tartar — hardened plaque "
        "that can't usually be removed by brushing alone. A professional "
        "dental cleaning is the best way to get rid of it and prevent gum "
        "irritation."
    ),
    "discolored teeth": (
        "Teeth can become yellow or stained from coffee, tea, smoking, or "
        "just natural aging of the enamel. Regular brushing with a whitening "
        "toothpaste helps with surface stains. For deeper discoloration, "
        "a dentist can suggest safe whitening options."
    ),
    "cavity/tooth decay": (
        "Cavities form when bacteria in your mouth produce acid that eats "
        "into the tooth enamel. Small cavities might not hurt at first, "
        "but they can grow if left untreated. A dentist can fill them before "
        "they get worse."
    ),
    "bad breath": (
        "Bad breath is often caused by bacteria on the tongue, food stuck "
        "between teeth, or gum issues. Brushing your tongue, flossing daily, "
        "and staying hydrated usually helps. If it sticks around, it could "
        "be worth a dental check-up."
    ),
    "swollen gums": (
        "Swollen gums are usually a sign of inflammation from plaque buildup "
        "or the early stages of gum disease. Gentle brushing along the gum "
        "line, flossing, and saltwater rinses can help bring the swelling "
        "down over time."
    ),
    "loose tooth": (
        "A loose tooth in adults is usually caused by gum disease that has "
        "weakened the supporting bone, or sometimes by injury. This is "
        "definitely worth seeing a dentist about as soon as possible to "
        "prevent further damage."
    ),
    "gum pain": (
        "Sore gums can happen because of irritation from plaque, brushing "
        "too hard, or the start of gum disease. Try switching to a "
        "soft-bristled brush and doing warm saltwater rinses. If it "
        "continues for more than a week, check in with a dentist."
    ),
    "wisdom tooth": (
        "Wisdom teeth can cause pain and swelling when they're coming in, "
        "especially if there isn't enough room or they're growing at an "
        "angle. Rinsing with warm saltwater helps with discomfort. A dentist "
        "can take an X-ray to see what's going on."
    ),
    "broken tooth": (
        "A broken or chipped tooth can be caused by biting something hard, "
        "an injury, or weakened enamel. Avoid chewing on that side and see "
        "a dentist as soon as you can — they can bond, cap, or fill the "
        "tooth depending on the damage."
    ),
    "jaw pain": (
        "Jaw pain can come from teeth grinding, TMJ issues, or tension in "
        "the jaw muscles. Avoiding hard or chewy foods and applying a warm "
        "compress can help. If it persists or your jaw clicks or locks, "
        "a dentist or TMJ specialist can help."
    ),
    "mouth ulcer": (
        "Mouth ulcers are usually caused by minor irritation, stress, or "
        "certain foods. They typically heal on their own within a week or "
        "two. Rinsing with warm saltwater or using an over-the-counter "
        "gel can help with the discomfort."
    ),
    "dry mouth": (
        "Dry mouth happens when your salivary glands don't produce enough "
        "saliva, which can increase the risk of cavities. Staying hydrated, "
        "chewing sugar-free gum, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help. "
